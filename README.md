## Demo
You can run through the app here: https://peach-644f1.web.app/ **(Camera does not work on web app)**

## Getting Started
- Before getting started, you will need to have NodeJS installed, found [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).

- After installing NodeJS, install Ionic CLI following instructions from [here](https://ionicframework.com/docs/intro/cli).

- You will also need to have a Google Firebase account for your backend database. In order to setup your own firebase project, follow steps 1 and 2 from [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup). 

**Take a note of your firebase config, it will look like this:**

```var firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "AIzaSyDOCAbC123dEf456GhI789jKl01-MnO",
  authDomain: "myapp-project-123.firebaseapp.com",
  databaseURL: "https://myapp-project-123.firebaseio.com",
  projectId: "myapp-project-123",
  storageBucket: "myapp-project-123.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "65211879809",
  appId: "1:65211879909:web:3ae38ef1cdcb2e01fe5f0c",
  measurementId: "G-8GSGZQ44ST"
};
```

1. ```git clone``` this project to your desired directory.
2. Go into the "Peach" directory that is created and run ```npm install``` or ```sudo npm install```.
3. Next, create a new file in ```Peach/src/app``` called **firebaseConfig.ts**
4. Paste the following code into the newly created file:

```
export const firebaseConfig = {
    var firebaseConfig = {
      apiKey: "API_KEY",
      authDomain: "PROJECT_ID.firebaseapp.com",
      databaseURL: "https://PROJECT_ID.firebaseio.com",
      projectId: "PROJECT_ID",
      storageBucket: "PROJECT_ID.appspot.com",
      messagingSenderId: "SENDER_ID",
      appId: "APP_ID",
      measurementId: "G-MEASUREMENT_ID",
    };
  };
```

5. Replace the config information with your firebase project's config from earlier.

6. You are done, run ```ionic serve``` inside the Peach directory to run the app locally.
